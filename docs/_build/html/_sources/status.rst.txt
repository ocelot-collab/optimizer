Project Status
==============

Currently OcelotInterface is in production using the simplex algorithm, non normalized.

The normzization of simplex parameter code is ready, but a good solution for calculating parameters based on energy is not.
For now the normalization checkbox remains disabled. This could be enabled, but will proabaly stay this way for now.

Versions for the GP scanner are ready and have benn run, but not enabled in produciton.
